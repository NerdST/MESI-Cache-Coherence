// Test 5: Cache line eviction and write-back
// ADDRESS_MEMWRITE_L1ID_DATA_CYCLE
// Addresses with same index but different tags (direct-mapped cache)
// This tests write-back buffer and dirty line eviction
// SEQUENTIAL execution: each write must complete before next starts

// Step 1 (Cycle 0): Write to address 0x00000000
00000000_1_0_AAAAAAAA_0

// Step 2 (Cycle 1): Write to address 0x00002000 (different tag, same index, evicts prev)
00002000_1_0_BBBBBBBB_1

// Step 3 (Cycle 2): Write to address 0x00004000 (evicts second line)
00004000_1_0_CCCCCCCC_2

// Step 4 (Cycle 3): Read from address 0x00000000 (should miss, line was evicted)
00000000_0_0_00000000_3

// Step 5 (Cycle 4-5): Test eviction with different L1s
